# WELCOME!

This repository is where you will find everything to do with the SCOPE (Science, Communication, Outreach, Participation and Education) research group. 

Our work is open source so please have a browse :smiley: To get started, head on over to the [wiki](https://github.com/kym834/Template_SCOPE/wiki) where you can find information about us and the projects we are working on.

SCOPE is based at the University of Sydney, Australia.
